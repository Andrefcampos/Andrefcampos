# André Campos
Software developer focused on fundamentals, systems, and infrastructure.

---

I'm a developer with a constant interest in understanding how things work under the hood. My journey spans different languages, levels of abstraction, and types of projects — always with technical curiosity, hands-on experimentation, and a focus on real control over what I'm building.

I don't limit myself to a single stack. My repositories reflect technical exploration, study projects, utility tools, and practical initiatives that prioritize clarity, control, and deep understanding of the problem.
